YourFitnessPal web application is a website for help you to have a better life and stay healthy. We will advise you what to eat
to do for each day. You can tell us which exercise you like and we will make a schedule for you. The other things are Diets, which foods you should eat or shouldnâ€™t eat, which day is your free day and you can save your information by creating a user to login to our website.
